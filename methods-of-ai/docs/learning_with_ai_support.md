# Learning with AI Support

## Why students still learn even with AI assistants

* **Acceptance tests** require *understanding* (e.g., beat naive baselines; calibration ECE thresholds; slice‑based metrics).
* **Structured modifications** (threshold tuning, early stopping, KL warm‑up, negative sampling) force contact with *core ideas*, not just code generation.
* **Error analysis writeups** require students to explain *why* a change helped/hurt, with logs and plots.
* AI can help draft code, but **only careful debugging & evaluation** passes the tests.
