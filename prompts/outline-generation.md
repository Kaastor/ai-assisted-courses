Design a 6-Meeting Beginner Course Toward Applied AI Engineer Skills

**Role:** You are a senior Applied AI Engineer and instructor who designs practical, beginner-friendly curricula.

**Goal:** Create a 6-meeting class for beginners on **Methods of Artificial Intelligence** that cultivates the core habits of an applied AI engineer: problem framing, data handling, modeling, validation, error analysis, explainability/ethics, simple deployment, and communication.

**Audience & constraints**

* Audience: undergrads / CS / mixed background with prerequisites; basic Python or fluent programming skills.
* Time per meeting: 2 hours of explanation meeting, assignments to take home. Total meetings: **6**.
* Compute & tools: Local environment, github for version control is a must (teacher will use Github Classroom for assignments and autograding), stack should follow best practices.
* Data policy: use **small, public datasets**; avoid heavy compute; ensure reproducibility (fixed seeds).
* Teaching style: **applied-first**, necessary math, visuals over proofs, measurable outcomes each session.
* Deliverables: a tiny end-to-end project and a demo in Meeting 6.

**What to produce (final answer only, no internal reasoning):**

1. **Course snapshot (1 paragraph):** who it’s for, what they’ll build, and the core skills they’ll practice.
2. **Skill map table:** rows = core engineer skills (framing, data, modeling, validation, error analysis, explainability/ethics, deployment, communication); columns = Meeting #1–#6; mark where each skill is practiced.
3. **Seven-meeting plan (one page total):** for each meeting, give:

   * Title & learning objectives (3–5 bullets)
   * Core topics (keep beginner-friendly)
   * Hands-on lab (datasets + exact steps)
   * Homework (≤60 min)
   * Success criteria/checkpoints (how we know they got it)
4. **Mini-project brief (half page):** scope, acceptance criteria, suggested datasets, and the “ritual” (define metric → split → baseline → improve → error analysis → explainability → simple app).
5. **Assessment & rubric (brief):** point weights for labs, homework, project demo, and a short reflection on ethics & limitations.
6. **Tech stack & setup:** versions, quickstart links, template notebook structure, and any scaffolding you’ll provide.
7. **Risk & mitigation:** likely beginner pitfalls (data leakage, overfitting, metric confusion, environment issues) and exactly how the course design prevents them.
8. **Accessibility & ethics notes:** dataset considerations, bias checks (group metrics), and disclosure of limitations.
9. **Stretch paths (optional):** 2–3 extensions for faster students (e.g., x-val, SHAP, Grad-CAM, simple A/B of two models).

**Topic guidance (customize to {specific topic}):**

* Emphasize an **end-to-end pipeline** in this domain.
* Prefer **transfer learning / tree ensembles** for quick wins.
* Include at least: baseline vs. improved model, proper validation, error slicing, a basic interpretability technique appropriate to the domain, and a **lightweight deploy** (CLI or Gradio).

**Formatting:**

* Use Markdown with clear section headers.
* Provide one compact table for the 6-meeting schedule (rows = Meeting 1–6; columns = Objectives | Topics | Lab | Homework | Checkpoint).
* Keep the whole output concise but actionable.

**Tone:** encouraging, concrete, beginner-friendly.

**Do NOT include:** chain-of-thought or development notes—only the final plan.

### Tiny example (filled, topics only)

* M1: From Problem to Metric — turn a real task into a target + baseline.
* M2: Data to First Model — clean/split data; train a simple baseline.
* M3: Stronger Model — introduce {transfer learning / trees}; tune safely.
* M4: Validate Right — holdout vs. CV; leakage traps; pick a metric that matches the goal.
* M5: Error Analysis — slice by subgroup; confusion matrix; fix one failure mode.
* M6: Explainability — SHAP/Grad-CAM

---

### Emphasis: What students should learn after the course

Short answer: **mostly, yes—but it’s “decision-making + verification + communication.”**
When AI writes the boilerplate, the student’s highest-value work shifts to the parts machines don’t own:

* **Problem framing:** define the objective, target, constraints, and success metric that actually match the use case.
* **Metric & threshold choice:** pick ROC-AUC vs PR-AUC, set a threshold from a **cost matrix**, and justify it.
* **Data judgment:** spot leakage, decide what to drop/engineer, check stratification and support sizes for slices.
* **Validation design:** choose CV vs holdout, prevent peeking, compute CIs, read calibration/Brier—not just a single score.
* **Error analysis & fairness:** select slices, interpret gaps, propose trade-offs or mitigations.
* **Result auditing:** reproduce numbers from artifacts, sanity-check LLM output, catch subtle bugs (e.g., encoder settings).
* **Communication:** write the model card, defend choices in a 3-minute demo, explain counterfactuals/limitations.
* **Ops hygiene:** seeds, versioning, pipelines, and reproducible runs—so others can trust the work.

In other words, AI accelerates **typing**; your course makes them practice **thinking**: deciding *what to do*, *why*, *how to verify it*, and *how to explain it*.
